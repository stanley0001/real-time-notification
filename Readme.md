Scalable real-time notification in go

Users to follow each other
Users to receive real-time notification about new poats,comments and messages

1.microservices architecture 
System as a collection of micro services that communicate via APIs
  User service---user acounts and profiles
  Post service---handles creation, storage and retriva of posts
  Notification service---generates and delivers real-time notifications
Utilize message brockers (kafka/Rabbit mq) for assync communication between services

2.Real-Time Notification
  mechanism to push notification to the users in real-time(web sockets,server sent events),or message queues
  Efficient delivery and minimize server load when pushing notifications to a large number of ussers.
 
3.Scalability 
  Handle growing number of users and concurent requests(docker,kubernates)
  Caching mechanism to improve performance and reduce database load(Redis).

4.Parcistence
  Choose suitable database, relation or NoSQL(postgres or mongo)
  Consider data partitioning and shading strategies for horizontal scaling of the database.

5.Monitoring and Observerbility
  Intergrate monitoring tools to track system health,perforance matrics, and identify potential bottlenecks

Extras 
 Implement user preference for notification types and delivery channels(email,push)
 Intergrate with user precence system to optimize notification delivery(only send notifiv=cation to active users)
 Security measures to prevent anauthorised acess and malicious activity

Deliverables
  Detailed system design document outlining the choosen microservice arctecture,communication protocols and data storage strategies
  Code demonstrating core fucntionalities(proof of concept) --go
 
Tested skillsets
  Microservice design principles
  Building APIs and inter-service communication
  Real-time communiation technologies
  Scallability and performance optimisation
  Database management
  Monitoring and observebility
